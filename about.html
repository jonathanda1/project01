      <h2>Simon</h2>
      <p>Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, with software programming by Lenny Cope, The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley but now the game is currently manufactured by Hasbro. Much of the assembly language was written by Dr. Charles Kapps, who taught computer science at Temple University and also wrote one of the first books on the theory of computer programming. Simon was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

      <h3> How to </h3>
      <p>The device has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.

      In my version of Simon, there are just three levels with sequences of 4,6,8 respectively. There is an extra level if the user can beat the first three.   </p>

      <h4> Impact </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In the 1987 Stephen King's novel The Tommyknockers, a forgotten SIMON game, left in the back seat of a reporters car, activates itself and, in an ever accelerated color switching frenzy, overheats and melts its casing, scorching the seat beneath. The driver, surprised by this, knocks it to the floor before the whole thing goes up in flames.</li>
          <li> There have been many copies of Simon including Monkey See, Monkey Do and Follow Me among many others.</li>
